This repository contains tools that I use for maintaining my electronic music collection.

It can check the bandwidth of an audio file with a custom algorithm and check if the file contains byte problems.

It can format the tags and file names of wav flac and mp3 files and download album artwork.

For now you have to install https://github.com/raraz15/electronic_music_downloader for tag filling features.
